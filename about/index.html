	<p>Like most of us, I spend nearly all of my daylight hours paying attention to glowing rectangular screens. By night, I like to make things with my hands, without the ability to ‘undo’. These physical projects become a laboratory for noticing things about the world that exists outside of two dimensions.</p>
