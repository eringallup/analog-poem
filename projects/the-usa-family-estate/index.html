                    On March 7, 2009 the belongings of the Usa Family were up for auction. Those in attendance were given money for the auction and told that they were allowed to touch and inspect all items on the tables. At 11pm the auction was canceled and the visitors were told to release their money.

                    The Usa Family Estate was a life-sized diorama of America's economic crisis, with a storyline told through the belongings of a fictitious family. Older generations' items were durable and made of quality materials. Younger generations' items mirrored their elders but were cheap in quality and made in China.

                    This work traced the evolution of modern, foreign-made disposable goods which represented the country's economic turning point.
