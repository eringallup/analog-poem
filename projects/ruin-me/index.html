                    Ruin Me featured original artwork- prints of people, paintings of land, sea & sky, photographs of a salary and drawings of nature that were destroyed by the people who came to the opening night.
                    </p>

                    <p class="left">
                    Near each artwork, suspended from the ceiling, were the implements that the visitors used to ruin each piece: scissors, pens, markers, a saw, corkscrew and hammer.
                    </p>

                    <p class="left">
                    The ruined artworks were for sale and priced less than the cost of the materials used to produce them.
                    </p>

                    <p class="left">
                    Throughout the night, an original score by <a href="http://scottweiser.com/" target="blank">Scott Weiser</a> was also presented and ruined.
